# Smart-Shopping-Basket-Real-Time-Object-Detection-Using-YOLOv8

The objective of this project is to leverage AI technology to enhance the shopping experience. The system detects items placed in a shopping basket using an AI model, identifies them in real time, and, in future iterations, will calculate the total price and provide the final amount at checkout. This project introduces an AI-powered system that recognizes products without the need for manual input, offering a streamlined and convenient experience for customers and retailers.

## Current Stage: 

At this stage, the focus is on object detection using the YOLOv8 model. The system accurately recognizes different items placed in the basket and displays the results in real time. Future work will involve integrating price calculation for each item and saving the data into a database, completing the automated checkout process.

  - Technology and Tools Used:

    - YOLOv8: Chosen for its precision and speed in real-time object detection.
    - Python: For programming and running the detection algorithms.
    - Hardware (optional): Depending on user setup, it can run on devices like Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi, or any system that can handle object detection models.

## Future Work:

  - Price calculation for each detected item.
  - Integration of a database to store product data and transaction history.
  - User-friendly interface for store owners and customers to monitor purchases.
